### Project 1
- To think atomic design, treat items as blocks and name their classes appropriate to what they are. https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/
- HTML/CSS file names stick to lowercase-names-with-dashes
- Think about why you should maybe split your css into different files?
- Think about how to create a more global css file, something to share. (globals.css)


#### What's Next

- Create a new branch from main
- Enter Chat index.html page. The button should link to our chat room.
- Replicate https://www.sketchappsources.com/resources/source-image/whats-app-chat-details-view-gayatriraut.jpg
- Should end up with 5 files (2 html, 3 css)
